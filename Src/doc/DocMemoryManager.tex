\chapter{Memory Manager}

provide memory needs time $O(n)\Rightarrow$ slow!

\underline{ idea: vector management }
\vspace{-1ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item organize unused vectors in a stack: first in, first out
\item need new vector: search in stack \\ fitting vector in stack $\rightarrow$ reuse \\ no fitting vector $\rightarrow$ allocate memory
\end{itemize}

\underline{ restrictions for stack-size: }
\vspace{-1ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item number of vectors in stack\\ default: \texttt{max\underline{ }retain = 128}
\item used memory\\ default: \texttt{memusage\underline{ }limit = 256MB}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\underline{ good: } \\ vectors of non needed length disappear from the stack first

\underline{ bad: } \\ need many vectors of different length $\rightarrow$ slower! \\
solution: switch off memory manager ( set variables to zero )

\underline{ public methods to use memory manager: }
\begin{itemize}
\item protected method \texttt{allocate( lenght )}: reuse vector in stack, if possible (call by constructor)
\item protected method \texttt{deallocate( *ptrDataType, length )}: put vector into stack (call by destructor)
\item public method \texttt{reserve( length )}: extends vector, if \texttt{vector.size() < length}
\item public method \texttt{resize()}: extends or shortens vector
\item public method \texttt{deleteUnlocked( number )}: deletes ( number ) vectors from stack
\item public method \texttt{setMaxRetain( number )}: changes \texttt{max\underline{ }retain}
\item \textbf{TODO: } method for changing \texttt{memusage\underline{ }limit}
\end{itemize}
