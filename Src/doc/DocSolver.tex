\subsection {Using solver}
we want to solve the system of linear equations $Ax = b$ with a properly solver

$//$ declaration and instantiation:\\
$//$ operator\\
\texttt{{\em solverclass}< {\em templateparameter} > A( {\em parameterlist} ); }\\[2ex]
$//$\texttt{b}: right hand side \\
$//$\texttt{x}: initial value $\rightarrow$ solution \\
\texttt{VectorType b( {\em parameterlist} ), x( {\em parameterlist} ); \\
initialise\underline{ }rhs( b ); \\ initialise\underline{ }start( x );}\\[2ex]
$//$ solve equation Ax=b\\
\texttt{A.apply( b, x );}

after iteration: \texttt{x} = solution of equation

\subsection{ example: heat equation }

\[ \partial_t u - \kappa \triangle u = f \]

weak formulation and time discretization (implicit euler):
\begin{eqnarray*} \int \frac{ \left(u^{i+1} - u^i\right) \phi}{\tau} & = & - \int \kappa \nabla u^{i+1} \nabla \phi + \int f \phi \\
\Rightarrow (M + \tau \kappa L) U^{i+1} & = & M U^i + \tau M F
\end{eqnarray*}

for one timestep we have to solve \qquad $ Ax = b $ \\ [1cm]
with $x = U^{i+1}, A = M + \tau \kappa L$ and $ b = M U^i + \tau M F$

for simplicity: $\kappa = 1, f \equiv 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (M + \tau L)U^{i+1} = M U^i$
